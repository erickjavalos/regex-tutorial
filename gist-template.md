# Regex Tutorial

Regex (short for Regular Expression) is a pattern-matching language used to search, manipulate, and validate text. It consists of a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. This pattern can be used to match, replace or extract specific sequences of characters from a string. Below you will be able to see different applicaitons of Regex.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The regular expression uses the caret (^) and dollar sign ($) anchors to match the entire string, ensuring that the email address is the only thing in the string.

### Quantifiers

The regular expression uses the + quantifier to match one or more characters in the username and domain name parts of the email address. It also uses the {2,6} quantifier to match between 2 and 6 characters in the top-level domain part of the email address.
